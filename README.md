### Excel Dashboard For Informing Low Income and Elderly Assistance Grants

_________________________________________________________________

### Premise
##### We were tasked with creating a dashboard for Hand Up America, an organization that provides assistance for low income and elderly taxpayers.  We utilized excel for both analyzing the data and creating the dashboard.  The parameters for the dashboard were that it must include state level information and how those data compare to the national picture. 

#### Below are a series of questions used to help explore the data, develop an analysis and determine the best visualizations for the dashboard.

### Data Exploration Questions

1. Start by creating a table containing the state names, the number of total returns filed, and the number of elderly returns filed. Create a calculated column for the percentage of elderly returns out of total returns filed. Create this table in a new worksheet any way you'd like (recall `tidy data`, where each row is an observation and each column is a variable). One function you might find helpful for this task is the `OFFSET()` function.

2. Calculate the following information _*for each state*_ to gain insights into the data:  

    a. What percentage of tax returns filed are elderly returns? Create a plot showing the states with the ten highest percentages of elderly returns.


    b. Do elderly returns tend to show more or less than $50,000 adjusted gross income for states?

    c. Passive income may be more subject to volatility. How do active vs passive sources of income differ for each income bracket. Look at the percentage of total income (row 27) that comes from active sources -- salaries and wages + business or profession net income (rows 29 and 39) vs the percentage that comes from passive sources -- interest + dividends + capital gains (rows 31, 33, 41).  


3. For each state, calculate the total tax liability (row 144) per person. Use the number of exemptions (row 15) as a proxy for the number of people in the household. Donâ€™t forget that tax liability is given in thousands of dollars. What are the top 10 and bottom 10 states in this metric? Create a map to illustrate your findings.

4. Pull the list of top 10 states with the highest percentage of ` < $1` tax returns. Do this also for the highest percentage of ` > $1,000,000` returns. Can you think of contextual data that could help you understand these results better?

5. Use your findings from the above exercise and any other analyses you think of to create charts or visualizations that might help guide the decision making at HUA. Remember that HUA's goal is to `provide assistance for low income and elderly taxpayers`. Your deliverable will be a single dashboard that captures what you think are the most important factors for HUA to consider.

### Analysis
We determined which states had the most elderly tax returns and which states had the most low-income tax returns.  We defined low-income to be annual income of $25k or less.  When cross-referenced, we found the three states that were on both lists and determined those states would most benefit from assitance from Hand Up America.
