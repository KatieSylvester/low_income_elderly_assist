We were tasked with creating a dashboard for Hand Up America, an organization that provides assistance for low income and elderly taxpayers.  We utilized excel for both analyzing the data and creating the dashboard.  It was mandatory that the dashboard include state level information and how those data compare to the national picture.

## <a name="analysis"></a>Analysis/Conclusions
After exploring the data, we determined which states had the most elderly tax returns and which states had the most low-income tax returns.  We defined low-income to be annual income of $25k or less.  When cross-referenced, we found the three states that were on both lists and determined those states would most benefit from assitance from Hand Up America.
